This was my first midterm at UW. Coming into it, I wasn't really sure what to expect. After finishing the test, I thought I did okay. I was really happy when my score came back.

This is an image of my POV when I'm studying in Mary Gates Hall. It was during my third or fourth week, and I was doing some problems on my computer. 
I often go there between classes, and it is where I get a large part of my work finished. 
This and Suzallo are probably where I've spent the most time outside of my dorm this quarter. </p>

This is a screenshot/link of an assignment I did in my English class, which was a poem intended for self-reflection.
Now, I'm poem kind of guy, but I enjoyed the assignment nonetheless.
It provided an important opportunity to look inwards when I didn't really have a direction.
I think participating in similar activities can help put your goals and your future into perspective.
